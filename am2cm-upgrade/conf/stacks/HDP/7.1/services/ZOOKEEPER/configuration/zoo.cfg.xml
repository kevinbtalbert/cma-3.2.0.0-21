    <description> The AdminServer provides an HTTP interface to the four letter word commands. Commands are issued by going to the URL "/commands/[command name]", e.g., http://localhost:8080/commands/stat. 
    The command response is returned as JSON.</description>

    <description>This property contains a list of comma separated Four Letter Words commands. 
    It is introduced to provide fine grained control over the set of commands ZooKeeper can execute, 
    so users can turn off certain commands if necessary. By default it contains all supported four letter word 
    commands except "wchp" and "wchc", if the property is not specified. 
    If the property is specified, then only commands listed in the whitelist are enabled.</description>

    <display-name>Trust In EmptySnapshot</display-name>
    <description> ZooKeeper will load the db without a snapshot file in case the transaction log files are present and valid.
      It is recommended to remove the property once you have a working server, because that check is important to ensure that the system is in good shape.</description>
